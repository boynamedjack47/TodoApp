# TodoApp
We have a To-Do app that allows users to create new lists for tracking whatever they need to get done
The goal is to make an easy to use application that allows users to make tasks and edit them to help boost productivity.
Users can create and name their lists.
We also provide the ability for users to store their completed tasks if they desire in an archive list. The lists will automatically move to the archive list when all tasks are completed.
If users don't want to store their completed lists they are free to delete them.
Users can delete lists whenever they'd like, even if they are incomplete.
Users are able to add tasks to lists, both completed and incomplete. On top of that they can edit each individual task and delete them.
To create a list users will select the create list button at the top of the page on the nav.
